## <a name="Project">Project Direction</a>
I decided to create this app to merge my two main passions coding and basketball. The main use case for my app is during a casual basketball game when the time and score easily get forgotten. Now you can just use my app and get back all the time wasted debating the time and score. I wanted to learn material UI so I used that for the responsive page layout and experimented with design and styling using SASS.

## <a name="Install">Installation</a>
* To clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:lroberts77/Tdd-react-practice.git
$ cd Tdd-react-practice
$ npm install
```

## <a name="Npmtest">Npm Testing</a>

```shell
$ npm test
```

## <a name="Usage">Usage</a>
* In the root of the project
```shell
$ npm start
```
If a tab doesn't open with the calculator app running, open a new tab and type in http://localhost:3000 in the url bar and press enter. After the basketball scoreboard has loaded click on the buttons to use the timer and adjust the score anf fouls for each team.

## <a name="Improvements">Improvements</a>
* limit fouls for each team to 5
* enable the user to change the names of each team
* test timer after elapsed time...
